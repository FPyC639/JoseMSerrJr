# Jose M Serra Jr

As a Kean University Student majoring in Mathematical Sciences concentration Data Analytics I have been enriching my undergraduate career in research and academics.  I have taken many courses in my undergraduate studies. The curricula consisting of Machine Learning, Foundation in Data Analytics, and Data Visualization led me to develop an interest in a doctoral concentration in Applied Mathematics. This Github will be showcasing my Data Analytics Skills with R and Python.  I will be showcasing my skills implemented from Kaggle Datasets with visualizations and statistical background.
